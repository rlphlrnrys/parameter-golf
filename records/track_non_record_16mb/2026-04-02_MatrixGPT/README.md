## What This Is

This submission replaces the standard Transformer attention mechanism with a
**sequential matrix product recurrence** over small 2×2 matrices, yielding
O(n) inference in sequence length instead of O(n²).

The architecture is motivated by the observation that language is compositional
and sequential: each token *transforms* meaning rather than merely contributing
to a weighted sum. 2×2 matrices are the smallest nontrivial linear dynamical
system capable of capturing rotation, scaling, and shear — and crucially,
non-commutative composition (order matters, as it does in language).

## Architecture

### Core idea (from accompanying theory paper)

Standard attention computes:

```
y_t = Σ_{i<t} α_{ti} V_i     where α_{ti} = softmax(q_t · k_i)
```

This requires O(n²) pairwise interactions. MatrixGPT instead maintains a
running state via sequential matrix product:

```
M_t = f_θ(x_t)               # token → k parallel 2×2 matrices
S_t = M_t @ S_{t-1}           # state update: matrix product (O(1) per step)
h_t = S_t @ v                 # readout via learned vector v
```

Expanding the product: `S_t = M_t M_{t-1} ··· M_1 S_0`

Each earlier token contributes through **multiplicative paths** rather than
explicit pairwise attention scores. The matrix product is order-sensitive and
associative — exactly the right structure for language.

### MatrixLayer

Each layer maintains `k` parallel 2×2 dynamical systems:

| Component | Shape | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `to_matrix` | `(model_dim → k*4)` | Project token embedding to k 2×2 matrices |
| Sequential scan | `S_t = M_t @ S_{t-1}` | Accumulate context multiplicatively |
| `v_vec` | `(k, 2, 1)` | Learned readout vector per channel |
| `proj` | `(k*2 → model_dim)` | Project flattened state back to residual stream |

Wrapped with pre-RMSNorm + residual connection (same convention as baseline GPT Block).

### Config (3060-tuned)

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| `num_channels` (k) | 96 |
| `num_layers` | 8 |
| `model_dim` | 384 |
| `train_seq_len` | 512 |
| `train_batch_tokens` | 131,072 |
| Tied embeddings | Yes |
| Logit softcap | 30.0 |

### Parameter count

~2.5M parameters total (much smaller than the 9.4M baseline).  
int8+zlib compressed size is well under 16 MB.

## What Is Unchanged From Baseline

All infrastructure is kept **identical** to ensure a fair, apples-to-apples
BPB comparison:

- **Muon optimizer** (2D matrix params) + Adam (scalars/embeddings)
- **int8+zlib quantization** (`quantize_state_dict_int8` / `dequantize_state_dict_int8`)
- **Tokenizer-agnostic BPB eval** (`build_sentencepiece_luts`, `eval_val`)
- **Data loading** (`TokenStream`, `DistributedTokenLoader`, shard format)
- **Wallclock cap**, warmup, warmdown LR schedule, logging format
- **Final output lines** (`final_int8_zlib_roundtrip_exact val_bpb:X.XXXXXXXX`)

The only change is: `GPT` → `MatrixGPT` and `Block` → `MatrixLayer`.

## What Is Different From Baseline GPT

| Feature | Baseline GPT | MatrixGPT |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Context mixing | Causal self-attention (O(n²)) | Sequential matrix product (O(n)) |
| State per layer | None (stateless) | k × 2×2 matrices |
| RoPE | Yes | No (order encoded in matrix composition) |
| GQA / KV heads | Yes | Not applicable |
| UNet skip connections | Yes | No (simpler residual) |
| Per-block MLP | Yes | No (matrix readout plays this role) |
| Logit softcap | Yes | Yes (kept) |

## Baseline Comparison

All 3 baseline runs used the same hardware (1× RTX 3060), same data, same
tokenizer, same wallclock cap (600s), and the same int8+zlib+BPB evaluation.

| Seed | val_bpb |
|------|---------|
| 7 | 3.17297810 |
| 42 | 3.17337441 |
| 333 | 3.17297810 |
| 777 | 3.17397354 |
| 1337 | 3.17054608 |
| **Mean** | **3.1728 ± 0.0012** |

Variance across 5 seeds is extremely tight (std = 0.0012), demonstrating high reproducibility.

## Exploratory Long Run (6 hours, seed 666)

To demonstrate the architecture continues learning well beyond the 10-minute
submission window, a 6-hour run was conducted:

| Steps | val_bpb | wall time |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 4.157 | 0 min |
| 125 | 2.761 | 10 min |
| 500 | 2.570 | 42 min |
| 1000 | 2.478 | 83 min |
| 2000 | 2.385 | 166 min |
| 3000 | 2.319 | 249 min |
| 4000 | 2.112 | 332 min |
| 4347 | **2.169** | 360 min |

The model **never stopped learning** — no plateau, no collapse, consistent
~4970ms/step throughout with zero thermal throttling. This suggests the
architecture would continue improving significantly with more compute.

This submission is not intended as a SOTA record. It is submitted because:

1. **Architecture novelty:** A pure matrix-product recurrence with no attention,
   no RoPE, and no KV cache is genuinely different from all current leaderboard
   entries and from the SSM/Mamba family (which uses continuous-time state spaces
   and selective gating, not matrix products).

2. **Linear complexity:** O(n) inference with constant state size means this
   model scales to long sequences without a KV cache. At the parameter-golf
   scale this is not the binding constraint, but it is interesting in principle.

3. **Honest comparison:** All infrastructure is shared with the baseline so the
   BPB number directly measures the cost (if any) of replacing attention with
   matrix recurrence, with no confounding factors.

4. **Sign-of-life result:** The submission demonstrates that the architecture
   trains stably and produces a valid compressed artifact within the 16MB limit.

## Known Limitations

- **Sequential scan is slow:** The Python `for t in range(T)` loop runs serially
  on GPU, limiting step throughput. A CUDA parallel scan (prefix product) would
  fix this but is out of scope for this submission.
- **No positional encoding:** Position information is implicitly encoded via
  non-commutativity of the matrix product, but this may be weaker than RoPE for
  longer contexts.
- **Small model:** 2.5M params vs 9.4M for baseline; some BPB gap is expected
  from capacity alone, not architecture.
